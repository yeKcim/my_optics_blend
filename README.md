# My optics blend

A blender library to easily create 3D optics diagrams. I add elements when I need them. 

First of all, intended for my personal use. A bit of frenglish (sorry about that).

# License

I don't know‚Ä¶ WTFPL or CC? Is that useful to define a license while no one but me will use these files?

* Add my free-space optics (blender files)
